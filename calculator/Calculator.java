package calculator;

/*
 This calculator program is incomplete but still has a good deal of functionality.  It allows for the use of brackets (which it handles recursively)
 as well as making available trigonometric functions.  The calculator "borrows" the design of the Casio calculator which I used at university, although
 cleaner GUI's are available through other means.  There are still some bugs in the code but it operates largely as intended.
 
 This calculator was written by Nicholas Lilley.
